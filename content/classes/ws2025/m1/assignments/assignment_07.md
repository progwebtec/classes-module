Pick an algorithm that you don't know yet from about the last third part of an algorithm textbook (that is, not the basic ones done in a bachelor's curriculum), learn about it, write a brief summary containing some sort of diagram and create an implementation.

If you find an application from within a project or other course you're working on, the better!
