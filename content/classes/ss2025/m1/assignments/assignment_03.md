Please hand in this exercise in teams of three to four.
All of you need to hand in the same PDF report with clear indications of your individual contributions.


This exercise is about getting to know ci/cd pipelines with the examples of github actions.

## Assignment


### 1. Pick 2-3 examples

1. find 2-3 examples of build pipelines in existing open source projects.
2. you may use your project from assignment 02, as well as any of the candidates for the open source project
3. you may choose another platform/tool instead of github actions. 
4. if the actions are simple, you should look at three projects.

### 2. Analyse and understand the Build Pipelines / Github Actions

1. read and try to understand the github actions. What are they doing? is this an automated build, tests, or /and deployment?
2. how is the pipeline built?
3. write a brief summary and reflection

### 3. Build your own pipeline

1. build at least one pipeline/github action - 
either for the static code analysers in assignment 02, or, if this is not feasible (e.g. if the used tools have licence restrictions), for another project.

### 4. Write Up

As always, write up everything in your report, put your names on top and the sources used in the reference section.
