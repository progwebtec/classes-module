#### Development Topic: Building a Static Web Application

During the first week, you will work individually, but are free to help each other. 

Install Node and create a first (pure)
node app that serves at least one static html file. Follow the tutorial in unit 01 (lessons 3-7) in the book.

If you want, you can use your static html site to visualize your project idea.

##### Topic of the Week

Building a static web app:

- Create a simple node app without any other framework
- Work with git
- Tag the version where the sprint was completed with "sprint_01"
- Include the repo url in your status report (you can use any service, e.g. https://gitlab.rz.htw-berlin.de/)
  - Please use a public repository or grant read access to the lecturer
