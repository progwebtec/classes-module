Example source code for this lab: {{< source >}}
## Part 1 / Lab 07

Read through Chapter 8 (Testing).

1. set up jest. see the {{< source path="README-JEST.md">}} for my log and hints for the example project

1. create unit tests for your services (see "Testing the Middleware with Spies") - if
   you do not have services like in the example in your app, test another component
   that depends on mongoose using the Model/Mongoose Spies.

2. Add an End-to-End Test of the REST API. 

For the bored: Unit test your React-Components.
Include at least one snapshot test.
