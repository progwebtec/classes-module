### Lab Assignments

During the labs, you will work on a web application on a topic of your choice in a small team of 3-4 people.
Topic selection and Team/Group formation will be initiated in Lab 01, and finalized in Lab 02.

We will work with the method "Tech Driven Backlog": The tech topic is
given for each week and lab assignment, and you choose a feature for your project which allows you to practice 
and use the respective technologies.

During the labs and your additional preperation time/learning time during the week you will work together
on the assignment. 

The output will be a lab report in pdf format describing your work (more details will be in the assignments)
and your source code, provided in a git repository and tagged as specified in the lab assignment. 

Each team member has to upload the *same* lab report - the one that you wrote together - in the moodle assignment submission.
All team member names need to be at the top of the first page of this report. I will not assign grades to students
who have not submitted a report.



Labs will be graded with the  [Star Grading Scale](../../../../studies/grading/guideline#star-gradings-for-exercises).
