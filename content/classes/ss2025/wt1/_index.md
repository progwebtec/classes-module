# Welcome!


This course is an introduction to *distributed systems* with the practical example of *web applications*.

It will be
taught in German with all written material in English.
{{<comment>}}
 It will be
taught using the Java programming language, but it is not about the language.
Mastery of basic Java syntax as taught in Informatik I is assumed. We learned
primitive data types, statements and rules, interfaces and classes in
Informatik I. We will now be looking at more complex data structures and
algorithms which work on these data structures.

### Grading of Lab Reports

The grading of the lab reports depends on how many lab reports you hand in and get an "ok" for:

Less or equal to 60% of labs with an ok:  0% for the lab part.
61%-100% of lab reports with an ok:, you will receive 1-40 Points of the maximum of 40 Points for the labs.

You may hand in a lab a second time using one of the late slots.
