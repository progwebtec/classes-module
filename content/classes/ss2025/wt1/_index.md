Welcome!


This course is an introduction to *distributed systems* with the practical example of *web applications*.

It will be
taught in German with all written material in English.
{{<comment>}}
 It will be
taught using the Java programming language, but it is not about the language.
Mastery of basic Java syntax as taught in Informatik I is assumed. We learned
primitive data types, statements and rules, interfaces and classes in
Informatik I. We will now be looking at more complex data structures and
algorithms which work on these data structures.

## Course Setup

The class consists of 2h of lectures and 2h of lab each week. Please refer to the LSF
for time and location information (find a direct link above in the "External Links" menu).

### Lecture

The lecture will be based on the textbook "Distributed Systems, 4th ed." by Maarten van Steen and Andrew S. Tanenbaum. 
You can obtain a personalized digital copy for free on the book companion website: [https://www.distributed-systems.net/](https://www.distributed-systems.net/)

There will be small moodle quizzes for practice throughout the term, which are not mandatory, but can earn you a small bonus for your grade. The questions in 
these quizzes may or may not be part of the final exam.

### Labs

The labs are a mostly independent introductionary course on web development using Node, Express and Mongo as a common example for distributed systems.
Refer to the [Labs Page](./labs/) for more detailed information.

### E-Learning/Bank Holidays

The lecture and one of the two labs are on Thursdays, and there are **3** (!) bank holidays on thursdays this term. there will be no lecture and no labs in this week
(including the Tuesday lab the week after.) I will provide you with e-learning material to compensate for the lost time.

## Grades & Exam


Labs 2-n will be graded with a simple star scale, and together form a "studienbegleitende Teilmodulprüfung".
There will be a moodle exam at the end of term mostly on the lectures and some questions on the lab topics.
{{<alert>}}The first lab will not be graded, but is by itself a "undifferenzierte Teilmodulprüfung" 
and successful individual submission of this lab is required to participate in the Labs and in the Exam.{{</alert>}}
 
{{<alert danger>}}Die Abgabe des ersten Labs wird nicht mit benotet, ist aber Prüfungsvoraussetzung für die anderen Teile! {{</alert>}}

### Grading of Lab Reports

The grading of the lab reports depends on how many lab reports you hand in and get an "ok" for:

Less or equal to 60% of labs with an ok:  0% for the lab part.
61%-100% of lab reports with an ok:, you will receive 1-40 Points of the maximum of 40 Points for the labs.

You may hand in a lab a second time using one of the late slots.
